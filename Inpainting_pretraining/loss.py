"""
loss.py

Defines loss functions and evaluation metrics for 3D inpainting tasks.

Main features:
- Initializes MONAI's PerceptualLoss (AlexNet-based) for 3D perceptual loss computation.
- Initializes PSNRMetric for evaluating image reconstruction quality.
- Provides a robust perceptual_inpainting_loss_function that:
    - Computes perceptual loss between predicted and ground truth images.
    - Handles both training and validation modes (enabling/disabling gradients as needed).
    - Ensures tensors are on the correct device.
    - Handles errors gracefully to avoid training crashes.

Functions:
    perceptual_inpainting_loss_function(pred_img, groundtruth, is_training=True):
        Computes perceptual loss for 3D inpainting, with support for training and validation modes.
